                                 They are cheating!

                            Conduct such is

               <h4><span>VIT</span></h4>(to Giuseppe). If you're blinded
               Truly, say so

                       You can spy, sir!
                            Shut your eye, sir!
                       You may use it by and by, sir!
                            You can see, sir!
                            Don't tell me, sir!
                       That will do—now let it be, sir!</div>
      
        CHORUS            
               My papa he keeps three horses,
               Black, and white, and dapple grey, sir;
               Turn three times, then take your courses,
               Catch whichever girl you may, sir!
      
        CHORUS OF MEN.      My papa, etc.
      
        (Marco and Giuseppe turn round, as directed, and try to catch the
        girls.  Business of blind-man's buff.  Eventually Marco catches
        Gianetta, and Giuseppe catches Tessa.  The two girls try to
        escape, but in vain.  The two men pass their hands over the
        girls' faces to discover their identity.)
