        Fiametta, Giulia, Vittoria, and other Contadine discovered, each
        tying a bouquet of roses.
      
                              CHORUS OF CONTADINE.
      
                       List and learn, ye dainty roses,
                            Roses white and roses red,
                       Why we bind you into posies
                            Ere your morning bloom has fled.
                       By a law of maiden's making,
                       Accents of a heart that's aching,
                       Even though that heart be breaking,
                            Should by maiden be unsaid:
                       Though they love with love exceeding,
                       They must seem to be unheeding—
                       Go ye then and do their pleading,
                            Roses white and roses red!
      
                                    FIAMETTA.
      
                       Two there are for whom in duty,
                            Every maid in Venice sighs—
                       Two so peerless in their beauty
                            That they shame the summer skies.
                       We have hearts for them, in plenty,
                            They have hearts, but all too few,
                       We, alas, are four-and-twenty!
                            They, alas, are only two!
                       We, alas!
      
        CHORUS.                                 Alas!
      
        FIA.           Are four-and-twenty,
                       They, alas!
      
        CHORUS.                                 Alas!
      
        FIA.           Are only two.
      
        CHORUS.        They, alas, are only two, alas!
                       Now ye know, ye dainty roses,
                       Roses white and roses red,
                       Why we bind you into posies,
                            Ere your morning bloom has fled,
                            Roses white and roses red!
      
        (During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
        Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,
        then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder
        of the Chorus.)
      
                                      SOLI.
      
        FRANC.    Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
                  These floral tributes extraordinary?
      
        FIA.      For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
                  The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.
      
        GIU.      They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
                  To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.
      
        ANT.      Do all you maidens love them?
      
        ALL.                                    Passionately!
      
        ANT.      These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!
      
        GIOR.     But what of us, who one and all adore you?
                  Have pity on our passion, we implore you!
      
        FIA.      These gentlemen must make their choice before you;
      
        VIT.      In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.
      
        GIU.      When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
                  Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.
      
        FIA. and VIT.  Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.
      
        ANT.      With pleasure, nobody contradicente!
      
                            SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.
      
                       For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,
                       That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;
                            With loving and laughing,
                            And quipping and quaffing,
                       We're happy as happy can be, tra la—
                            With loving and laughing, etc.
      
                       With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,
                       And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;
                            And Jealousy yellow,
                            Unfortunate fellow,
                       We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—
                            And Jealousy yellow, etc.
      
        FIA. (looking off). See, see, at last they come to make their
        choice—
                       Let us acclaim them with united voice.
        (Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)
      
        CHORUS (Girls).     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
             Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.
                            Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!
      
        (Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)
      
                 DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE, with CHORUS OF GIRLS.
      
        MAR. and GIU.  Buon' giorno, signorine!
      
        GIRLS.              Gondolieri carissimi!
                       Siamo contadine!
      
        MAR. and GIU. (bowing).  Servitori umilissimi!
                            Per chi questi fiori—
                                 Questi fiori bellissimi?
      
        GIRLS.              Per voi, bei signori
                                 O eccellentissimi!
      
        (The Girls present their bouquets to Marco and Giuseppe, who are
        overwhelmed with them, and carry them with difficulty.)
      
        MAR. and GIU. (their arms full of flowers). O ciel'! O ciel'!
      
        GIRLS.                             Buon' giorno, cavalieri!
      
        MAR. and GIU. (deprecatingly).     Siamo gondolieri.
      
             (To Fia. and Vit.)            Signorina, io t' amo!
      
        GIRLS. (deprecatingly).            Contadine siamo.
      
        MAR. and GIU.                      Signorine!
      
        GIRLS (deprecatingly).             Contadine!
      
             (Curtseying to Mar. and Giu.) Cavalieri.
      
        MAR. and GIU. (deprecatingly).     Gondolieri!
                                           Poveri gondolieri!
      
        CHORUS.                            Buon' giorno, signorine, etc.
        DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

        We're called gondolieri,
        But that's a vagary,
        It's quite honorary
             The trade that we ply.
        For gallantry noted
        Since we were short-coated,
        To beauty devoted,
             Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;

        When morning is breaking,
        Our couches forsaking,
        To greet their awaking
             With carols we come.
        At summer day's nooning,
        When weary lagooning,
        Our mandolins tuning,
             We lazily thrum.

        When vespers are ringing,
        To hope ever clinging,
        With songs of our singing
             A vigil we keep,
        When daylight is fading,
        Enwrapt in night's shading,
        With soft serenading
             We sing them to sleep.

        We're called gondolieri, etc.
