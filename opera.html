                      <p> List and learn, ye dainty roses,<br>
                            Roses white and roses red,<br>
                       Why we bind you into posies<br>
                            Ere your morning bloom has fled.<br>
                       By a law of maiden's making,<br>
                       Accents of a heart that's aching,<br>
                       Even though that heart be breaking,<br>
                            Should by maiden be unsaid:<br>
                       Though they love with love exceeding,<br>
                       They must seem to be unheeding—<br>
                       Go ye then and do their pleading,<br>
                            Roses white and roses red!<br></p>

                            Every maid in Venice sighs—<br>
                       Two so peerless in their beauty<br>
                            That they shame the summer skies.<br>
                       We have hearts for them, in plenty,<br>
                            They have hearts, but all too few,<br>
                       We, alas, are four-and-twenty!<br>
                            They, alas, are only two!<br>

       <h2> CHORUS. <br></h2>       <p>They, alas, are only two, alas!<br>
                       Now ye know, ye dainty roses,<br>
                       Roses white and roses red,<br>
                       Why we bind you into posies,<br>
                            Ere your morning bloom has fled,<br>

        <p>(During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other<br>
        Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,<br>
        then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder<br>
        of the Chorus.)<br></p>

        <h2>FIA.</h2><br>  <p>(looking off). See, see, at last they come to make their<br>
        choice—<br></p>
                      <p> Let us acclaim them with united voice.<br>

        <p>DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.<br>

        We're called gondolieri,<br>
        But that's a vagary,<br>
        It's quite honorary<br>
             The trade that we ply.<br>
        For gallantry noted<br>
        Since we were short-coated,<br>
        To beauty devoted,<br>
             Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;<br>

        When morning is breaking,<br>
        Our couches forsaking,<br>
        To greet their awaking<br>
             With carols we come.<br>
        At summer day's nooning,<br>
        When weary lagooning,<br>
        Our mandolins tuning,<br>
             We lazily thrum.<br>

        When vespers are ringing,<br>
        To hope ever clinging,<br>
        With songs of our singing<br>
             A vigil we keep,<br>
        When daylight is fading,<br>
        Enwrapt in night's shading,<br>
        With soft serenading<br>
             We sing them to sleep.<br>

        We're called gondolieri, etc.<br>
        RECITATIVE—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.<br></p>

        <h2>MAR.<br></h2>           <p>A bias to disclose<br>

                       You have luck extraordinary;<br>
                            We might both have been unsightly!<br>
                            If we judge your conduct rightly,<br>
                       'Twas a choice involuntary;<br>

                       It is scarcely necessary<br>
                            To express our pleasure.<br>
                            Each of us to prove a treasure<br>
                            Gladly will devote our leisure,<br>

        Giuseppe.)<br></p>

        enter the Duke of Plaza-toro, the Duchess, their daughter<br>
        Casilda, and their attendant Luiz, who carries a drum.  All are<br>
        dressed in pompous but old and faded clothes.)<br></p>
