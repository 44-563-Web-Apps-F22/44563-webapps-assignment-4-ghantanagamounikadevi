        Fiametta, Giulia, Vittoria, and other Contadine discovered, each
        tying a bouquet of roses.
      
                              CHORUS OF CONTADINE.
      
                       List and learn, ye dainty roses,
                            Roses white and roses red,
                       Why we bind you into posies
                            Ere your morning bloom has fled.
                       By a law of maiden's making,
                       Accents of a heart that's aching,
                       Even though that heart be breaking,
                            Should by maiden be unsaid:
                       Though they love with love exceeding,
                       They must seem to be unheeding—
                       Go ye then and do their pleading,
                            Roses white and roses red!
      
                                    FIAMETTA.
      
                       Two there are for whom in duty,
                            Every maid in Venice sighs—
                       Two so peerless in their beauty
                            That they shame the summer skies.
                       We have hearts for them, in plenty,
                            They have hearts, but all too few,
                       We, alas, are four-and-twenty!
                            They, alas, are only two!
                       We, alas!
      
        CHORUS.                                 Alas!
      
        FIA.           Are four-and-twenty,
                       They, alas!
      
        CHORUS.                                 Alas!
      
        FIA.           Are only two.
      
        CHORUS.        They, alas, are only two, alas!
                       Now ye know, ye dainty roses,
                       Roses white and roses red,
                       Why we bind you into posies,
                            Ere your morning bloom has fled,
                            Roses white and roses red!
      
        (During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
        Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,
        then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder
        of the Chorus.)
      
                                      SOLI.
      
        FRANC.    Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
                  These floral tributes extraordinary?
      
        FIA.      For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
                  The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.
      
        GIU.      They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
                  To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.
      
        ANT.      Do all you maidens love them?
      
        ALL.                                    Passionately!
      
        ANT.      These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!
      
        GIOR.     But what of us, who one and all adore you?
                  Have pity on our passion, we implore you!
      
        FIA.      These gentlemen must make their choice before you;
      
        VIT.      In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.
      
        GIU.      When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
                  Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.
      
        FIA. and VIT.  Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.
      
        ANT.      With pleasure, nobody contradicente!
      
                            SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.
      
                       For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,
                       That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;
                            With loving and laughing,
                            And quipping and quaffing,
                       We're happy as happy can be, tra la—
                            With loving and laughing, etc.
      
                       With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,
                       And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;
                            And Jealousy yellow,
                            Unfortunate fellow,
                       We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—
                            And Jealousy yellow, etc.
      
        FIA. (looking off). See, see, at last they come to make their
        choice—
                       Let us acclaim them with united voice.
        (Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)
      
        CHORUS (Girls).     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
             Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.
                            Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!
      
        (Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)
      
                 DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE, with CHORUS OF GIRLS.
      
        MAR. and GIU.  Buon' giorno, signorine!
      
        GIRLS.              Gondolieri carissimi!
                       Siamo contadine!
      
        MAR. and GIU. (bowing).  Servitori umilissimi!
                            Per chi questi fiori—
                                 Questi fiori bellissimi?
      
        GIRLS.              Per voi, bei signori
                                 O eccellentissimi!
      
        (The Girls present their bouquets to Marco and Giuseppe, who are
        overwhelmed with them, and carry them with difficulty.)
      
        MAR. and GIU. (their arms full of flowers). O ciel'! O ciel'!
      
        GIRLS.                             Buon' giorno, cavalieri!
      
        MAR. and GIU. (deprecatingly).     Siamo gondolieri.
      
             (To Fia. and Vit.)            Signorina, io t' amo!
      
        GIRLS. (deprecatingly).            Contadine siamo.
      
        MAR. and GIU.                      Signorine!
      
        GIRLS (deprecatingly).             Contadine!
      
             (Curtseying to Mar. and Giu.) Cavalieri.
      
        MAR. and GIU. (deprecatingly).     Gondolieri!
                                           Poveri gondolieri!
      
        CHORUS.                            Buon' giorno, signorine, etc.
        DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

        We're called gondolieri,
        But that's a vagary,
        It's quite honorary
             The trade that we ply.
        For gallantry noted
        Since we were short-coated,
        To beauty devoted,
             Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;

        When morning is breaking,
        Our couches forsaking,
        To greet their awaking
             With carols we come.
        At summer day's nooning,
        When weary lagooning,
        Our mandolins tuning,
             We lazily thrum.

        When vespers are ringing,
        To hope ever clinging,
        With songs of our singing
             A vigil we keep,
        When daylight is fading,
        Enwrapt in night's shading,
        With soft serenading
             We sing them to sleep.

        We're called gondolieri, etc.
        RECITATIVE—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

        MAR.           And now to choose our brides!
      
        GIU.                As all are young and fair,
                       And amiable besides,
      
        BOTH.               We really do not care
                                 A preference to declare.
      
        MAR.           A bias to disclose
                            Would be indelicate—
      
        GIU.           And therefore we propose
                            To let impartial Fate
                            Select for us a mate!
      
        ALL.                     Viva!
      
        GIRLS.         A bias to disclose
                            Would be indelicate—
      
        MEN.           But how do they propose
                            To let impartial Fate
                            Select for them a mate?
      
        GIU.      These handkerchiefs upon our eyes be good enough to
        bind,
      
        MAR.      And take good care that both of us are absolutely
        blind;
      
        BOTH.     Then turn us round—and we, with all convenient
        despatch,
                  Will undertake to marry any two of you we catch!
      
        ALL.                     Viva!
                  They undertake to marry any two of us\them they catch!
      
        (The Girls prepare to bind their eyes as directed.)
      
        FIA. (to Marco).    Are you peeping?
                                 Can you see me?
      
        MAR.                Dark I'm keeping,
                                 Dark and dreamy!
      
                                                     (Marco slyly lifts
        bandage.)
      
        VIT. (to Giuseppe). If you're blinded
                                 Truly, say so
      
        GIU.                 All right-minded
                                 Players play so!
            (slyly lifts bandage).
      
        FIA. (detecting Marco).  Conduct shady!
                                 They are cheating!
                            Surely they de-
                                 Serve a beating!
               (replaces bandage).
      
        VIT. (detecting Giuseppe).    This too much is;
                                 Maidens mocking—
                            Conduct such is
                                 Truly shocking!
               (replaces bandage).
      
        ALL.                You can spy, sir!
                            Shut your eye, sir!
                       You may use it by and by, sir!
                            You can see, sir!
                            Don't tell me, sir!
                       That will do—now let it be, sir!
      
        CHORUS OF GIRLS.    My papa he keeps three horses,
                                 Black, and white, and dapple grey, sir;
                            Turn three times, then take your courses,
                                 Catch whichever girl you may, sir!
      
        CHORUS OF MEN.      My papa, etc.
      
        (Marco and Giuseppe turn round, as directed, and try to catch the
        girls.  Business of blind-man's buff.  Eventually Marco catches
        Gianetta, and Giuseppe catches Tessa.  The two girls try to
        escape, but in vain.  The two men pass their hands over the
        girls' faces to discover their identity.)
      
        GIU.           I've at length achieved a capture!
          (Guessing.)  This is Tessa!  (removes bandage).  Rapture,
        rapture!
      
        CHORUS.        Rapture, rapture!
      
        MAR. (guessing).    To me Gianetta fate has granted!
                                 (removes bandage).
                            Just the very girl I wanted!
      
        CHORUS.        Just the very girl he wanted!
      
        GIU. (politely to Mar.). If you'd rather change—
      
        TESS.                                   My goodness!
                       This indeed is simple rudeness.
      
        MAR. (politely to Giu.). I've no preference whatever—
      
        GIA.           Listen to him!  Well, I never!
                       (Each man kisses each girl.)
      
        GIA.           Thank you, gallant gondolieri!
                            In a set and formal measure
                       It is scarcely necessary
                            To express our pleasure.
                            Each of us to prove a treasure,
                       Conjugal and monetary,
                            Gladly will devote our leisure,
                       Gay and gallant gondolieri.
                            Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.
      
        TESS.          Gay and gallant gondolieri,
                            Take us both and hold us tightly,
                       You have luck extraordinary;
                            We might both have been unsightly!
                            If we judge your conduct rightly,
                       'Twas a choice involuntary;
                            Still we thank you most politely,
                       Gay and gallant gondolieri!
                            Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.
      
        CHORUS OF      Thank you, gallant gondolieri;
        GIRLS.              In a set and formal measure,
                       It is scarcely necessary
                            To express our pleasure.
                            Each of us to prove a treasure
                            Gladly will devote our leisure,
                       Gay and gallant gondolieri!
                            Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.
      
        ALL.           Fate in this has put his finger—
                            Let us bow to Fate's decree,
                       Then no longer let us linger,
                            To the altar hurry we!
      
        (They all dance off two and two—Gianetta with Marco, Tessa with
        Giuseppe.)
      
        (Flourish.  A gondola arrives at the Piazzetta steps, from which
        enter the Duke of Plaza-toro, the Duchess, their daughter
        Casilda, and their attendant Luiz, who carries a drum.  All are
        dressed in pompous but old and faded clothes.)
      
        (Entrance of Duke, Duchess, Casilda, and Luiz.)
      
        DUKE.     From the sunny Spanish shore,
                  The Duke of Plaza-Tor!—
      
        DUCH.     And His Grace's Duchess true—
      
        CAS.      And His Grace's daughter, too—
      
        LUIZ.     And His Grace's private drum
                  To Venetia's shores have come:
      
        ALL.           If ever, ever, ever
                            They get back to Spain,
                       They will never, never, never
                            Cross the sea again—
      
        DUKE.     Neither that Grandee from the Spanish shore,
                  The noble Duke of Plaza-Tor'—
      
        DUCH.     Nor His Grace's Duchess, staunch and true—
      
        CAS.      You may add, His Grace's daughter, too—
      
        LUIZ.     Nor His Grace's own particular drum
                  To Venetia's shores will come:
      
        ALL.      If ever, ever, ever
                       They get back to Spain,
                  They will never, never, never
                       Cross the sea again!
      
             DUKE.  At last we have arrived at our destination.  This is
        the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor
        resides.  As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I
        regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse.  As a
        Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to
        ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an
        unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that
        equestrian exercise is impracticable.  No matter.  Where is our
        suite?
             LUIZ (coming forward).  Your Grace, I am here.
             DUCH.  Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when
        you address His Grace?
             DUKE.  My love, it is so small a matter!  (To Luiz.)  Still,
        you may as well do it.  (Luiz kneels.)
             CAS.  The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect
        appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian
        hidalgo.
             DUKE.  My child, you are hard upon our suite.
             CAS.  Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons
        in his plebeian position.  If he does not appreciate that
        position, let him be whipped until he does.
             DUKE.  Let us hope the omission was not intended as a
        slight.  I should be much hurt if I thought it was.  So would he.
        (To Luiz.)  Where are the halberdiers who were to have had the
        honour of meeting us here, that our visit to the Grand Inquisitor
        might be made in becoming state?
             LUIZ.  Your Grace, the halberdiers are mercenary people who
        stipulated for a trifle on account.
             DUKE.  How tiresome!  Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor
        is a blind gentleman.  And the band who were to have had the
        honour of escorting us?  I see no band!
             LUIZ.  Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required
        to be paid in advance.
             DUCH.  That's so like a band!
             DUKE (annoyed).  Insuperable difficulties meet me at every
        turn!
             DUCH.  But surely they know His Grace?
             LUIZ.  Exactly—they know His Grace.
             DUKE.  Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf
        gentleman.  A cornet-a-piston would be something.  You do not
        happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a
        cornet-a-piston?
             LUIZ.  Alas, no, Your Grace!  But I can imitate a farmyard.
             DUKE (doubtfully).  I don't see how that would help us.  I
        don't see how we could bring it in.
             CAS.  It would not help us in the least.  We are not a
        parcel of graziers come to market, dolt!
                                                                    (Luiz
        rises.)
             DUKE.  My love, our suite's feelings!  (To Luiz.)  Be so
        good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his
        Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro—
             DUCH.  And suite—
             DUKE.  And suite—have arrived at Venice, and seek—
             CAS.  Desire—
             DUCH.  Demand!
             DUKE.  And demand an audience.
             LUIZ.  Your Grace has but to command.
             DUKE (much moved).  I felt sure of it—I felt sure of it!
        (Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.)  And now, my love—(aside to
        Duchess)  Shall we tell her?  I think so—(aloud to Casilda)  And
        now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise.  It is my
        agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you
        the happiest young lady in Venice!
             CAS.  A secret?
             DUCH.  A secret which, for State reasons, it has been
        necessary to preserve for twenty years.
             DUKE.  When you were a prattling babe of six months old you
        were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son
        and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of
        Barataria!
             CAS.  Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria?
        Was I consulted?  (Duke shakes his head.)  Then it was a most
        unpardonable liberty!
             DUKE.  Consider his extreme youth and forgive him.  Shortly
        after the ceremony that misguided monarch abandoned the creed of
        his forefathers, and became a Wesleyan Methodist of the most
        bigoted and persecuting type.  The Grand Inquisitor, determined
        that the innovation should not be perpetuated in Barataria,
        caused your smiling and unconscious husband to be stolen and
        conveyed to Venice.  A fortnight since the Methodist Monarch and
        all his Wesleyan Court were killed in an insurrection, and we are
        here to ascertain the whereabouts of your husband, and to hail
        you, our daughter, as Her Majesty, the reigning Queen of
        Barataria!  (Kneels.)
      
        (During this speech Luiz re-enters.)
      
             DUCH.  Your Majesty!  (Kneels.) (Drum roll.)
             DUKE.  It is at such moments as these that one feels how
        necessary it is to travel with a full band.
             CAS.  I, the Queen of Barataria!  But I've nothing to wear!
        We are practically penniless!
             DUKE.  That point has not escaped me.  Although I am
        unhappily in straitened circumstances at present, my social
        influence is something enormous; and a Company, to be called the
        Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, is in course of formation to work
        me.  An influential directorate has been secured, and I shall
        myself join the Board after allotment.
             CAS.  Am I to understand that the Queen of Barataria may be
        called upon at any time to witness her honoured sire in process
        of liquidation?
             DUCH.  The speculation is not exempt from that drawback.  If
        your father should stop, it will, of course, be necessary to wind
        him up.
             CAS.  But it's so undignified—it's so degrading!  A Grandee
        of Spain turned into a public company!  Such a thing was never
        heard of!
             DUKE.  My child, the Duke of Plaza-Toro does not follow
        fashions—he leads them.  He always leads everybody.  When he was
        in the army he led his regiment.  He occasionally led them into
        action.  He invariably led them out of it.
      
                            SONG—DUKE OF PLAZA-TORO.
      
                       In enterprise of martial kind,
                            When there was any fighting,
                       He led his regiment from behind—
                            He found it less exciting.
                       But when away his regiment ran,
                            His place was at the fore, O—
                                 That celebrated,
                                 Cultivated,
                                 Underrated
                                      Nobleman,
                            The Duke of Plaza-Toro!
      
        ALL.           In the first and foremost flight, ha, ha!
                       You always found that knight, ha, ha!
                                 That celebrated,
                                 Cultivated,
                                 Underrated
                                      Nobleman,
                            The Duke of Plaza-Toro!
      
        DUKE.          When, to evade Destruction's hand,
                            To hide they all proceeded,
                       No soldier in that gallant band
                            Hid half as well as he did.
                       He lay concealed throughout the war,
                            And so preserved his gore, O!
                                 That unaffected,
                                 Undetected,
                                 Well-connected
                                      Warrior,
                            The Duke of Plaza-Toro!
      
        ALL.           In every doughty deed, ha, ha!
                       He always took the lead, ha, ha!
                                 That unaffected,
                                 Undetected,
                                 Well-connected
                                      Warrior,
                            The Duke of Plaza-Toro!
      
        DUKE.          When told that they would all be shot
                            Unless they left the service,
                       That hero hesitated not,
                            So marvellous his nerve is.
                       He sent his resignation in,
                            The first of all his corps, O!
                                 That very knowing,
                                 Overflowing,
                                 Easy-going
                                      Paladin,
                            The Duke of Plaza-Toro!
      
        ALL.           To men of grosser clay, ha, ha!
                       He always showed the way, ha, ha!
                                 That very knowing,
                                 Overflowing,
                                 Easy-going
                                      Paladin,
                            The Duke of Plaza-Toro!
      
        (Exeunt Duke and Duchess into Grand Ducal Palace.  As soon as
        they have disappeared, Luiz and Casilda rush to each other's
        arms.)
